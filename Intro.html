        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Anson Seabra — a singer, songwriter, and producer from Kansas City.</p>
            <p>I write songs for anyone who’s ever felt a little lost, a little heartbroken, or like the world’s just too much sometimes. Music has always been a safe place for me, and I try to create that same space for others — a place to be honest, to feel deeply, and to know you’re not alone.
            </p>

            <p>
            My journey into music wasn’t traditional. I started out studying computer science and even worked a 9-to-5 before deciding to follow my passion full-time. I taught myself how to produce and began uploading songs to the internet — not expecting much, just hoping to connect with even one person who might relate. Slowly, my music found its way to more ears and hearts than I ever imagined.
            </p>

            <p>
            You might know me from songs like <strong>“Welcome to Wonderland,” “Peter Pan Was Right,”</strong> or <strong>“Walked Through Hell.”</strong> They’re all pieces of me — honest reflections on love, loss, and the human condition. I tend to write late at night, when the world is quiet and thoughts get loud.
            </p>
            <p>
            Whether you're a long-time listener or just discovering my music, I’m glad you’re here. I hope my songs can be a soundtrack for your healing, your dreaming, or just your next late-night drive.
            </p>
            <p>Thanks for listening.</p>
            <p>— Anson</p>
